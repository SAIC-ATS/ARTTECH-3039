-   Computer Vision 1
    -   Applied Maths
        -   Applied Linear Algebra
            -   Vectors
                -   1-D (essentially just a number)
                -   2-D (e.g. `glm::vec2`, `ofVec2f`)
                -   3-D (e.g. `glm::vec3`, `ofVec3f`, `ofPoint`)
            -   Scalars
                -   These are individual numbers that "scale" (practically, this just means change the length)
            -   Lines
                -   Formed by two 2D vectors.
            -   Planes
                -   Formed by three 3D points.

            -   Relationships between Vectors
                -   Dot Product
                -   Cross Product

            -   Linear / Affine Transformations
                -   A mathematical operation usually represented as a 3x3 or 4x4 matrix that transforms an input vector into an output vector (`ofPushMatrix()`, `ofTranslate()`, `ofRotate()`, `ofScale`, etc create and apply these vectors).
            -   Basis Vectors
            -   Homogenous Coordinates
        -   Graphics
            -   Polygons
    -   Drawing with Linear Algebra
    -   Projection Mapping, Homography
    -   Labeling
        -   Connected components.





- Classical Computer Vision Part 0
  - Binary Images
    - Why binary images?
      - Background vs. Foreground
    - Background Subtraction
      - Importance of "helpful" auto-camera parameters
        - Auto gain, auto white balance, auto shutter speed, etc.
        - Should be fixed for many background subtraction situations.
      - Fixed Background Subtraction
        - `examples/computer_vision/opencvExample`
      - Adaptive Background Subtraction
        - `ofxCv/example-background`
    - Brightness Thresholding
      - Fixed Threshold
        - `ofxCv/example-threshold`
      - Adaptive Threshold
        - `ofxCv/example-threshold` (press mouse)
  - Image Filtering
    - Brightness, Contrast, etc.
    - Morphological Operators, Lines and Edges
      - Hough, Canny, Scharr, Sobel, Structured Forest, [etc](http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d0/da5/tutorial_ximgproc_prediction.html)
