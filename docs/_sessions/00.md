- Review, as time permits.
  - git / github
    - Set up command line.
    - Fork, clone, add, commit, push, pull-request.
  - openFrameworks
    - Installation
      - Development version (clone `master` vs. download nightly)
    - Directory layout.
    - Project Generator
      - How to generates project files.
    - Install initial addons
      - Many addons found at [http://ofxaddons.com/](http://ofxaddons.com/).
        - Tips for finding "fresh" addons.
      - Addons we'll use
        - [ofxPS3EyeGrabber](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxPS3EyeGrabber/)
          - A driver for the cheap and versatile [PS3 Eye Camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Eye).
        - ofxOpenCv _(Included with openFrameworks as a core addon)_
          - Contains the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) library.
          - Contains some older classes to simplify interacting with OpenCV in openFrameworks.
        - [ofxCv](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxCv) (_develop branch of @bakercp's fork is up-to-date with latest openFrameworks_)
          - Contains a lot of OpenCV examples along with a modern collection of wrappers.
    - Compiling an openFrameworks application
      - Compiling with Xcode.
      - Compiling on the command line with the `Makefile`.
