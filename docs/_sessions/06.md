  - [Multi-Person Pose Estimation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW6nZXeWlGM) and [this](https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation)

  - Simple Infinite Impulse Response [Low Pass Filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter#Simple_infinite_impulse_response_filter)
   > Low-pass filters provide a smoother form of a signal, removing the short-term fluctuations, and leaving the longer-term trend.

  - Homography and Rectification
  - Video Mapping / Quad Mapping
  - Detection
  - Recognition

  - Contemporary Sensing with RGB+D
    - Kinect

    - Skeleton Tracking
  - LIDAR
  - Point Clouds

- Machine Learning 2
  - Image Generation with [Pix2Pix](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix), ([example](https://github.com/brangerbriz/docker-StackGAN))
