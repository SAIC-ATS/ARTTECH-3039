2.  Questions to Test Yourself
    -   What is a ...
        -   ... Data Feature?
            -   Basically a feature is a directly measurable, calculable or observable property of a datum or phenomena to be classified. Choosing useful features is difficult. Good features or combinations of features help differentiate between different pieces of data.  
        -   What are some "features" that might be used to classify / group students in a school?
        -   What are some "features" that might be used to classify an email as spam?
        -   What are some "features" that might be used to classify a painting as masterful?
        -   "Feature vector" [a rough idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_vector))
        -   "Feature space"
    -   ... Convolutional Filter?
        -
    -   When we process an image using the ofxCcv neural network, what is produced?
    -   When submit the outcome of the ofxCcv to ofxTSNE, what is produced?
    -   When we submit the output of ofxTSNE to ofxAssignment, what is produced?

2.  Example Explorations (we did many of these in class).
    -   Compile and run all examples from [ofxCcv](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxCcv).
    -   Compile and run all examples from [ofxTSNE](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxTSNE).
    -   Compile and run all examples from [ofxAssignment](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxAssignment).

4.  Make your own TSNE visualization.  Building from the image grid example in `ofxTSNE`, submit a large collection of your own images (either personal or downloaded from the internet) to the process.  Click [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/LIav0Kwd) to accept.
