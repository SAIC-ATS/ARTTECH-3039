description: >
  Computer vision allows machines to see and understand their environment. This
  course will equip students with the practical skills and critical theory
  needed to both employ and critically engage these techniques. Real-time body
  tracking, facial recognition and gesture analysis using RGB+D and LiDAR
  sensors, artificial intelligence and machine learning will be emphasized.
  Students will explore and critique contemporary applications ranging from
  automated mass surveillance to interactive installations. A final project will
  build on in-class workshops, technical exercises, critical readings and
  discussions.

    bio: >
      Amay Kataria (b. 1990) is a global artist intersecting technology with modern art mediums for self-expression. Born and brought up in Delhi, the capitol city of India, he developed artistic tendencies at the age of 14, when he started learning instruments like guitar and harmonica. After placing 1st in Future Cities India 2020 in 2007, a competition to design futuristic road architecture for Commonwealth Games held in India in 2010, his team of 4 students represented India in Washington D.C. to present their designs. During that trip, he visited U.S. universities and decided to pursue his college education abroad. At the age of 18, he moved to Virginia Tech to pursue Computer Engineering. While studying engineering, he took classes in philosophy, music appreciation, interdisciplinary product design, robotics, hardware-software, and embedded systems. After graduating from Tech in 2012, Amay joined Windows team in Microsoft as a Software Engineer in Seattle, WA.

      He explored his passion for arts through music production, attending creative writing workshops, and painting & drawing lessons in Seattle Community College and Gage Academy of Arts. In 2014, he moved to Skype4Life project in Microsoft under the mentorship of Eric Traut. During this time, he collaborated with designers, product managers, and led the development of several high-impact features for the brand new Skype app. He also participated in creative hackathons to work with modern art mediums like Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Sound to expand his repertoire of creative mediums. Ultimately, while attending Burning Man in Nevada in 2015, when his artistic tendencies were at peak, Amay decided to pursue graduate education in fine arts. He began collating a portfolio for a MFA and left his job at Microsoft in Summer, 2017 to start school in Fall, 2017. Currently, he is pursuing a MFA in Art & Technology Studies at SAIC and is expected to graduate in 2019.
