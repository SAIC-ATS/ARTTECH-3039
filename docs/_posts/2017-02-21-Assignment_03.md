2. Code
  - The goal of this week is to build from our class example to explore the techniques used to create the Manual Input Sessions.
  - Please refer to [this video](http://www.flong.com/projects/mis/) for examples and documentation.
  - Building off of the [Physics Contour](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-3039/tree/master/Week_03/physics_contour) example, implement at least one of the following:
      - Emit sounds when the negative shape body interacts with other bodies (see the box2d collision example for ideas).
      - Make the hand in the video interact with the negative shape body by adding its polygon contour as a collision shape.
  - Research `std::map` and understand what this does:

  ```
  // What is the type of auto?
  // what does holes.find(deadLabel) do?
  auto iter = holes.find(deadLabel);

        // What is holes.end()?
        if (iter != holes.end())
        {
            ofPolyline polyline = iter->second; // What is iter->second?
            // Create the shape!

            // ...
        }
  ```

3. Notes

```
    // Untested code for finding the maximum convex hull defect.
    // myDefects ...

    float maxDepth = std::numeric_limts<float>::lowest();
    std::size_t maxIndex = 0;

    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < myDefects.size(); ++i)
    {
      if (myDefects[i].depth() > maxDepth)
      {
        maxIndex = i;
      }
    }

    // if there were any defects, this would find the _last_ biggest.

    // this is the biggest defect in the bunch
    myDefects[maxIndex]
```
